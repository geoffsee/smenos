name = "Aeromancer atmospheric intuition module"
goal = "Model and validate the Aeromancer’s ability to sense and manipulate atmospheric flow patterns"

context = """
The Aeromancer navigates by perceiving air currents as tactile, musical structures. This spec
formalizes that sensory-mapping system for use in simulations, training scenarios, and predictive modeling.
"""

tasks = [
  "Define the full range of atmospheric signatures the Aeromancer can detect",
  "Describe how tactile-airflow perception is translated into fine control inputs",
  "Simulate a high-winds obstacle course to test the sensing model",
  "Validate consistency across multiple atmospheric conditions"
]

deliverables = [
  "A functional description of the Aeromancer’s perception pipeline",
  "A test report from the simulated high-wind scenario"
