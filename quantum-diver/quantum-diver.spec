context = """
The Quantum Diver treats reality as a network of adjacent layers connected by momentary gateways.
This spec documents the mechanisms, constraints, and fail-safes that allow the Diver to move through
these layers intentionally and return reliably.

tasks = [
  "Define the conditions required to detect a stable transition surface",
  "Characterize the Diver’s perception of interlayer geometry",
  "Create a deterministic sequence for initiating a controlled dive",
  "Test return-path integrity across three simulated quantum topologies"
