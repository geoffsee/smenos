goal = "Document the procedures and thermal profiles required for forging nonstandard alloys in custom furnaces"

context = """
The Emberwright produces alloys that exhibit anomalous structural and energetic behavior.
Their furnaces operate outside typical engineering tolerances, using layered combustion cycles
and feedback-controlled thermal shaping. This spec defines the reproducible steps and constraints
for forging these materials.

tasks = [
  "List each alloy and its required thermal-phase sequence",
  "Record the Emberwright’s furnace modulation patterns",
  "Run controlled forging trials to verify repeatability",
  "Analyze failure cases and identify safe abort thresholds"

  "A reproducible forge sequence for all listed alloys",
  "Data logs from trial-run forging operations"
